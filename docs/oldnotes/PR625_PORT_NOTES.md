# PR-625 Port Notes

## Summary
- Added `LogicalLocationHash` and `rotl` to `src/mesh/mesh.hpp` to support efficient hashing of `LogicalLocation`.
- Added a smoke regression test `tst/scripts/mhd/amr_mhd_refine_smoke.py` that runs an MHD case with AMR enabled, ensuring refine + prolongation completes and history output is produced.

## Motivation
Athena++ PR 625 addressed issues in the AMR refine path (particularly MHD face fields) by ensuring receive-complete before prolongation and by staging additional face-field corrections across MPI. AthenaK’s AMR pipeline already separates receive and prolongation and uses its own divergence-preserving face-centered prolongation and flux-correction mechanisms. The hash utility aligns with upstream and enables neighbor maps keyed by `LogicalLocation` if needed.

## Changes in Detail
### 1) `src/mesh/mesh.hpp`
- Added 64-bit rotate-left helper:
  - `inline std::int64_t rotl(std::int64_t i, int s)`
- Added `struct LogicalLocationHash`:
  - Combines `lx1`, rotated `lx2`, and rotated `lx3` into a `std::size_t` hash.
- No behavioral change; header-only utility compatible with AthenaK style.

### 2) `tst/scripts/mhd/amr_mhd_refine_smoke.py`
- New regression test with two functions required by the harness:
  - `run()`: invokes `inputs/tests/linear_wave_mhd_amr.athinput` with reduced resolution and short runtime (tlim=0.2), ensuring AMR triggers quickly; history output interval set to 0.05.
  - `analyze()`: verifies the presence of `build/src/LinWave.mhd.hst` and requires at least one data row (non-comment).
- Purpose: smoke coverage for MHD+AMR refine/prolongation path, without overfitting to IO formats.

### 3) Test harness compatibility tweaks
- File: `tst/scripts/utils/athena.py`
  - Prefer `cmake3` if available; fallback to `cmake` via `shutil.which`.
  - Resolve CMake source directory robustly using the parent of `tst/` (works whether
    the harness is invoked from the repo root or from `tst/`).
  - Rationale: ensure `run_tests.py` can configure the project in environments where only
    `cmake` exists and/or when the script is launched from the repo root.

## What We Did Not Change
- No modifications to AMR algorithms (`RefineCC/RefineFC`) or MPI send/recv code paths.
- No adoption of Athena++'s `pbval->bvars_fine`-based exchange (AthenaK uses different boundary/flux mechanisms).

## Build Verification
- Local configure + build ran successfully with:
  - `cmake -S . -B build`
  - `cmake --build build -j2`
- Target `athena` compiled, linking against Kokkos (Serial backend by default).

## How to Run the New Test
- CPU regression subset:
  - `python3 tst/run_tests.py mhd`
  - Or single test: `python3 tst/run_tests.py mhd/amr_mhd_refine_smoke`

## Rationale
- Minimal, surgical changes: adhere to AthenaK’s existing design, avoid over-engineering.
- Provide upstream-aligned utility (`LogicalLocationHash`) for future neighbor mapping needs.
- Add a focused smoke test to catch regressions in the refine pipeline.
