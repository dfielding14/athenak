# Particle Merge Implementation Summary

## Completed (Weeks 1-4)

### 1. Unified Data Structures ✓
- Extended `ParticleType` enum to support cosmic_ray and star
- Added `ParticlesPusher` enum with boris_lin and boris_tsc options
- Created flexible particle indices in athena.hpp:
  - Common: IPX, IPVX, IPY, IPVY, IPZ, IPVZ
  - Cosmic Ray specific: IPM, IPBX-IPBZ, IPDX-IPDB
  - Star specific: IPT_CREATE, IPMASS, IPT_NEXT_SN

### 2. Type-Aware Constructor ✓
- Modified Particles constructor to handle both particle types
- Dynamic memory allocation based on particle type:
  - Cosmic rays: 14 real + 3 integer arrays (3D with tracking)
  - Stars: 9 real + 3 integer arrays
- Added species support for cosmic rays

### 3. Boris Pusher Implementation ✓
- Implemented PushCosmicRays() method with Boris algorithm
- Added support for both linear and TSC interpolation (linear implemented)
- Magnetic field interpolation from MHD bcc0 field
- Displacement tracking (dx, dy, dz, db) for diffusion studies

### 4. Code Structure
```
src/particles/
├── particles.hpp         # Extended class definition
├── particles.cpp         # Type-aware constructor + InitializeCosmicRays()
└── particles_pushers.cpp # Boris pusher implementation
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Cosmic Ray Support
- Multiple species with charge/mass ratios
- Boris pusher for charged particle dynamics
- B-field interpolation from MHD simulations
- Displacement tracking for diffusion analysis
- Compatible with 2D/3D simulations

### Maintained Star Particle Features
- File-based initialization
- RK4 gravity integrator
- Supernova feedback scheduling
- Mass and time tracking

## Testing Status
- ✓ Code compiles successfully
- ✓ No conflicts with existing star particle code
- ✓ Clean separation between particle types

## Next Steps (Weeks 5-8)
- Integration testing with actual simulations
- Performance optimization (GPU coalescing)
- Advanced TSC interpolation
- Mixed particle simulations
- Documentation and examples
